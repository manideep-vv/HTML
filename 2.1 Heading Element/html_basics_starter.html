<h1>Pigeon Racing</h1>


Pigeon racing is the sport of releasing specially trained homing pigeons,
which then return to their homes over a carefully measured distance. The
time it takes the animal to cover the specified distance is measured and
the bird's rate of travel is calculated and compared with all of the other
pigeons in the race to determine which animal returned at the highest
speed.

<p>
    Pigeon racing requires a specific breed of pigeon bred for the sport, the
    Racing Homer. Competing pigeons are specially trained and conditioned for
    races that vary in distance from approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) to
    1,000 kilometres (620 mi). Despite these lengths, races can be won and
    lost by seconds, so many different timing and measuring devices have been
    developed. The traditional timing method involves rubber rings being
    placed into a specially designed clock, whereas a newer development uses
    RFID tags to record arrival time.
